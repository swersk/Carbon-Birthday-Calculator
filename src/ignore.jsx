//       <h4>These levels are speeding up. As a comparison, carbon only increased TBD ppm during the 41 years before your birth.</h4>
//       <h3><em>Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is measured in parts per million (ppm). Yearly average carbon figures dating back to 1958 come from Mauna Loa (Hawaii) and the South Pole. Carbon figures before 1958 come from measurements of ice core samples in Antarctica.</em></h3>
